## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jacob Osborn, an HTML and CSS developer currently learning Javascript and C#.
I'm currently working through the Software Engineering program at TripleTen and plan to transition into this career path upon completion. I have over 10 years of experience in ecommerce management/strategy and plan to leverage these skillsets together to make waves at a growing SMB (small to medium business). 

- I'm currently working on my TripleTen coursework and on building a website and social following to promote my first board game which I plan to self-publish via crowdfunding in 2026
- I'm currently learning JavaScript via TripleTen while also learning C# on my own, with an eye for video game development.
- 2025 goals include finishing TripleTen, getting a new job in software engineering, and finalizing the online presence for my board game company
- Fun Fact: I am a junior instructor for a local Tai Chi school
